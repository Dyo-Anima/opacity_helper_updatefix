## Description

This add-on allows you to select multiple objects and update their material Blend Mode simultaneously, saving time and effort. No need to adjust materials individually; simply apply the desired setting to all selected meshes with active materials.

## What's New (v2.2.0)

- Updated for **Blender 4.3** compatibility.
- Removed outdated Blend Mode options (`MULTIPLY` and `ADD`) that are no longer supported.
- Renamed modes to reflect Blender's current terminology:
  - `Alpha Blended` (formerly Alpha Blend).
  - `Alpha Dithered` (formerly Alpha Hashed).
- Changes are now applied only to **mesh objects** with active materials, ignoring unsupported objects like bones or meshes without materials.
- Simplified and clarified UI in the toolbar for ease of use.
